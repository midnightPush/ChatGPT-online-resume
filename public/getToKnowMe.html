    <h1>Get To Know Me</h1>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy engaging in a variety of hobbies that help me
      relax and recharge. Some of my hobbies include reading books on technology
      and web development, exploring new programming languages, and
      participating in online coding challenges. I also have a keen interest in
      photography, capturing moments that inspire me and experimenting with
      different techniques. Additionally, I love staying active by practicing
      yoga and going for hikes in nature, which allows me to find balance and
      clarity of mind.
