    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a passionate and dedicated self-taught web developer with a strong
      desire to continuously expand my knowledge and skills in the field. I have
      a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from ABC University, where I
      gained a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. Through my
      freelance web development work and personal projects, I have honed my
      expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design. I thrive in
      dynamic and collaborative environments, where I can bring innovative ideas
      to life and deliver exceptional web solutions. With a strong attention to
      detail and a commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry
      trends, I strive to create engaging and user-friendly websites that make a
      positive impact.
